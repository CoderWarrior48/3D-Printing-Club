## Notes to my forgetful self

You just made a mess with a 'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded' and putting the content as json. just make the whole dang data json later, make sure to remove workarounds later.

also the title and route on the outside needs to be the same as the content>root>params title and route set by puckeditor. find a way to synch or rethink
